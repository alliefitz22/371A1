                This is a picture of me with an ice sculpture at the president's ball. 
                The ball was fun, but I waited a whole HOUR in line waiting to just get into the place.

            <p> The worst part about waiting an hour for the president's ball was that the staff members were telling people who arrived <b> AFTER</b> us to
            essentially cut in front of us. I was really frustrated, because I had waited a <i> whole hour</i> and had tried to arrive earlier while the late
            incomers had to wait signifigantly less ime</p>
            <p>Once I got to the ball, my anger quickly faded. 
                As soon as I came in, I saw people dancing on stage with the president and there were <b> FIREWORKS</b> which was super surprising. </p>
