                This is a picture of me with an ice sculpture at the president's ball. 
                The ball was fun, but I waited a whole HOUR in line waiting to just get into the place. 
                And then, I realized that people were literally cutting in front of us because staff TOLD THEM TO. 
                I was so frustrated. But once I got into the actual dance, I had fun. It was kind of crazy because right when
                I walked in the president was on stage with some dancers. And then FIREWORKS started to go off on the stage which
                really shocked me. But after that, the DJ started playing music again and I had a fun time.
