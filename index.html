        This is a picture of me with an ice sculpture at the president's ball. 
        The ball was fun, but I waited a whole HOUR in line waiting to just get into the place. 
        And then, I realized that people were literally cutting in front of us because staff TOLD THEM TO. 
        I was so frustrated. But once I got into the actual dance, I had fun. It was kind of crazy because right when
        I walked in the president was on stage with some dancers. And then FIREWORKS started to go off on the stage which
        really shocked me.
